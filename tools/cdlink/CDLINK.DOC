INTRODUCTION
------------

CD-Link is a device driver that allows DOS applications to access CD-ROM disk 
readers as if they were "standard" DOS-compatible disk drives.  For DOS users, 
it is an alternative to Microsoft's CD-ROM Extensions.  CD-Link is also 
available separately for The Software Link's PC-MOS operating system.

Supporting High Sierra and ISO 9660 disk formats, the driver will work with 
most popular CD-ROM drives and controllers.  

Some significant features of the product are:

  * Ability to use the hard disk as a large cache, for greatly
    improved performance without sacrificing memory.

  * Redirection of DOS function calls at the INT 21 level for
    easy interfacing to networks and alternative operating 
    systems.

  * RAM overhead approximately 8K for PC-MOS, 10K for DOS.

  * Works with vendors' existing low-level drivers, for
    compatibility with most popular CD-ROM hardware.

  * CDSTAT utility reports usage statistics, to simplify fine-
    tuning of the installation.


INSTALLATION
------------

YOUR USE OF THIS PRODUCT IS SUBJECT TO THE LICENSE AGREEMENT THAT IS CONTAINED
IN THE FILE LICENSE.DOC, PROVIDED WITH THIS SOFTWARE.  BE SURE TO PRINT THIS 
AGREEMENT AND DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER UNLESS YOU HAVE READ IT AND AGREE TO ITS 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

Installation of the product consists of copying CDLINK.SYS and CDSTAT.COM from
the installation diskette to your hard disk, adding a line to your CONFIG.SYS 
file, and rebooting the system.

The config.sys statement to be added has the following format:

  For DOS:

     DEVICE=CDLINK.SYS [D=devicename]
                       [C=cachefilespec] 
                       [K=cachefilesize]
                       [N=numberofdrives] 
                       [O=offsetvalue]
                       [H=numberofhandles] 
                       [L=longreadsectors]

  for PC-MOS:

     DEVICE=CDLINK.SYS [D=devicename]
                       [C=cachefilespec] 
                       [K=cachefilesize]
                       [N=numberofdrives] 
                       [O=offsetvalue]
                       [H=numberofhandles] 
                       [L=longreadsectors]
                       [T=numberoftasks]

Parameters must be all entered on one line, and are separated from each other 
by one or more spaces.  No spaces should be entered within a parameter, nor 
immediately before or after an "equals" sign.

More specifically, the optional parameters are as follows:

     <devicename> is the system name assigned to the hardware- 
     dependent CD-ROM device driver.  This name will either be 
     specified on the DEVICE= command line for that driver, or 
     will have a default value in that driver.  Default is 
     "MSCD001".

     <cachefilespec> is the fully qualified file specification 
     for the work file that CD-Link creates and uses for cacheing 
     of CD-ROM data.  "Fully qualified" means that a drive letter 
     and complete path specification must be supplied - e.g., 
     "C:\WORK\CACHE.DAT".  Default is "C:\CDLINKCA.CHE".  This 
     cache file is typically maintained on a hard disk, but users 
     with RAM to spare may want to implement it on a RAM-disk.

     <cachefilesize> is the number of kilobytes of disk space to 
     be allocated to the cache file.  Default is 122.  The 
     specified number may be rounded down by as much as 41K, 
     since the cache file is allocated in increments of 
     approximately this size.  This parameter is used only when 
     creating a new cache file, and is ignored if the file 
     already exists.

     <longreadsectors> is a number from 2 to 65,535 which specifies 
     the minimum number of whole CD-ROM sectors in a single read 
     request that will cause cacheing to NOT occur.  The theory is 
     that if there is a "long" read request for some large number 
     of contiguous sectors, then it may be better to always read 
     them directly from the CD-ROM as opposed to consuming large 
     portions of the cache file.  You use L= to specify this minimum 
     number.  Default is 16.

     <numberofdrives> is the number of physical CD-ROM drives 
     that are to be supported.  Default is 1.

     <offsetvalue> does not normally need to be specified.  It is 
     used to tell the system how to identify which file handles 
     are for CD-ROM files.  A byte value in the PSP handle table 
     that is greater than or equal to <offsetvalue>, but less 
     than <offsetvalue+numberofhandles>, is deemed to specify a 
     CD-ROM file handle.  This parameter is provided as a way to 
     resolve possible conflicts with other products, such as LAN 
     operating systems, that also apply offsets to file handle 
     table entries.  BEWARE THAT <OFFSETVALUE+NUMBEROFHANDLES> 
     MUST NEVER BE GREATER THAN 255.  Default is 200.  Allowable 
     range is 20-250.

     <numberofhandles> indicates the maximum number of CD-ROM 
     file handles that may be open at one time.  Default value is 
     20.  Allowable range is 5-235.  If you specify a value 
     greater than 63, then you will also have to specify 
     offsetvalue (see above).

     <numberoftasks> applies only to PC-MOS installations.  It 
     specifies the maximum number of system tasks that may access 
     CD-ROMs.  Default is 5 (1 if DOS is used).

No separate utilities are required to create or maintain the cache file.  The 
driver will at boot time automatically recognize and use an already-existing 
cache file with the name specified with the "C=" parameter, or if one does not
exist a new one will be created.  Therefore if you want to create a new cache 
file (e.g., to change its size), all you have to do is delete the old one and 
re-boot.

You are encouraged to make the cache file as large as practical.  Any size from
roughly 128K to several megabytes is reasonable.  Cached data remains in the 
file and will be re-used even after you power off your computer; this will 
translate to a significant performance benefit as the system "learns" your 
CD-ROMs.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Cacheing performance is closely tied to the performance of your
hard disk.  We strongly recommend that you use a cacheing utility for your hard
disk - or if you use PC-MOS, take the time to optimize your "cache=" parameters
(write cacheing IS recommended).


THE CDSTAT UTILITY
------------------

CDSTAT.COM is a program that you run to display statistical information about 
CD-Link.  Simply type CDSTAT at the command prompt, and the following 
information is displayed:

Short (cached) reads  - The total number of CD-ROM reads processed since 
                        the last time the computer was booted, where
                        the number of sectors requested was less than
                        the value of the "L=" parameter (see below); this
                        is regardless of whether the read was satisfied
                        from the cache.

Cache hits            - The number of read requests satisfied from the
                        cache since the last boot.

Cache index rewrites  - The number of times that a cache index record has
                        been modified since the last boot.  Frequent index
                        rewrites are an indication that performance can
                        be improved by making the cache file bigger.

Long (uncached) reads - The number of reads since the last boot where the
                        number of sectors requested was greater than or 
                        equal to the "L=" parameter.

Cache file opens      - The number of times since the last boot that the
                        cache file has been opened.  Normally, these opens
                        are infrequent.

Cache file errors     - The number of times since the last boot that an
                        I/O error occurred while processing the cache 
                        file.  A nonzero value here indicates a problem.

Capacity (sectors)    - The number of 2K CD-ROM sectors that may be held
                        in the cache file at any given time.

Sectors cached        - The number of CD-ROM sectors currently stored in 
                        the cache file.  Under normal use, this number
                        will reach the capacity fairly quickly.


DOS 5/6 AND WINDOWS
-------------------

The ability of DOS 5 and 6 to put itself, device drivers, and TSRs into upper 
memory is a big plus.  CDLINK (for DOS) appears to work well when loaded with 
the "DEVICEHIGH=" config.sys statement.

As noted above, use of a disk cacheing utility is strongly recommended.  We 
have had good results with SMARTDRV.EXE, which can also be loaded into upper 
memory with DOS 5 and greater.

If you are using EMM386.EXE or a similar memory manager, be sure to tell it to
avoid using the memory address space occupied by your SCSI controller.  For 
example, if your SCSI card uses 16K of address space starting at C8000, then 
the appropriate parameter for EMM386 is X=C800-CBFF.

Similarly, if you are using Windows 3.x in enhanced mode, you will need to add
an "emmexclude" statement to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file.  In
the above situation, the statement would be "emmexclude=C800-CBFF".

The following are the relevant CONFIG.SYS statements for a sample system using
a Corel LS2000 SCSI controller set for memory address C8000 with a NEC CD-ROM 
drive (this is only an example; your system will probably require different 
parameters):

  DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
  DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE X=C800-CBFF I=CC00-EFFF NOEMS
  DOS=HIGH,UMB
  DEVICEHIGH=C:\CORELDRV\NEC_LS2.SYS /ID:0 /MEM:C800 /N:1 /D:MSCD001
  DEVICEHIGH=C:\CDLINK.DOS C=C:\$CACHE$ D=MSCD001 K=1024 L=8

Some SCSI drivers may not let you specify the memory address of the board, 
instead looking for boards at all of the possible addresses.  This will cause a
problem if you have already loaded EMM386.  In such a case we suggest using a 
"DEVICE=" statement to load the hardware driver BEFORE the "DEVICE=" statement
for EMM386.


CONSIDERATIONS FOR PC-MOS USERS
-------------------------------

Note that CD-Link for DOS and MOS are DIFFERENT products.  The DOS version will
not work with PC-MOS, and vice versa.

To minimize CPU and RAM overhead, CD-ROM controllers using DMA are NOT 
recommended for use with PC-MOS.

Be sure to FREEMEM around the memory address space occupied by your SCSI 
controller!  For example, if your SCSI card uses 16K of address space starting
at C8000, then your PC-MOS config.sys parameter might be "FREEMEM=CC000,F0000"
(assuming the given range is otherwise not occupied by ROM or other hardware 
devices).

The following are the relevant CONFIG.SYS statements for a sample system using
a Corel LS2000 SCSI controller set for memory address C8000 with a NEC CD-ROM 
drive (this is only an example; your system will probably require different 
parameters):

  MEMDEV=C:\PCMOS\$386.SYS
  FREEMEM=CC000,F0000
  CACHE=1024,2,10,2,A,B,C
  SMPSIZE=64K
  DEVICE=C:\PCMOS\UPDAT501.SYS
  DEVICE=C:\CORELDRV\NEC_LS2.SYS /ID:0 /MEM:C800 /N:1 /D:MSCD001
  DEVICE=C:\CDLINK.MOS C=C:\$CACHE$ D=MSCD001 K=2048 L=8


PC-MOS USERS: IF YOUR CD-ROM CONTROLLER USES DMA
------------------------------------------------

Your best bet is to avoid DMA with PC-MOS.  However if this is not an option, 
do the following in your CONFIG.SYS file:

1. Set up a "split SMP" by using a SMPSIZE statement of the form
   "SMPSIZE=nnnK,nnnK", specifying enough memory in the second parameter
   to contain the CD-ROM hardware driver and the CDLINK.MOS driver
   (this requirement is usually less than 32K).

2. Use "LDEVICE=" (not "DEVICE=") to load both the CD-ROM hardware driver
   and CDLINK.MOS into the lower segment of the SMP.  In some cases this
   may not be necessary with the hardware driver.

3. Specify "L=500" in the CDLINK.MOS command line.  This will ensure that no 
   reads are performed directly into an application's task space.


WARNING - IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 1.00
----------------------------------------

CD-Link release 1.00 had a different cache file format from subsequent
releases.  Therefore if you are converting from 1.00 (or a beta version) be 
sure to delete your old cache file and reboot!


WARNING FOR HITACHI CD-ROM DRIVE USERS
--------------------------------------

A pecularity was found with the driver HITACHIA.SYS version 2.20, and may also
exist in other versions.  This driver requires that it be the LAST device in 
your config.sys file (let's hope this does not become a common requirement from
developers of device drivers!).

While we normally ask that CD-Link be installed after the associated hardware 
driver, it does appear to work correctly if the Hitachi driver comes last.
