# MOS86
An attempt to port the PC-MOS/386 OS to current build tools.

This is based off of the open source PC-MOS/386 v5.01 source code in Roeland Jansen's repository.  GPL v3 still applies.

Roeland's repository is on github at:

https://github.com/roelandjansen/pcmos386v501

From Roeland's README.md:

In concert with Gary Robertson and Rod Roark it has been decided to place all under GPL v3.
This does only apply to the PC-MOS/386/The Software Link inc/CDROM code. Does not apply for helper files that 
are included and publically available.

The PC-MOS386 v5.01 API itself has been documented in Ralf Brown's interrupt list.
